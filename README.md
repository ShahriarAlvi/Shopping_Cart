# Shopping_Cart

This is a website that will have the following purposes:
1. create a cart-based shopping interface "Shop Products"
2. provide a "Order Confirmation" page where the "checked-out" cart will be displayed
3. a video stream feed from an arduino (on the same network) will be displayed

The internal logic of the arduino is not the focus of this repo. This repo will contain the connection establishment protocol between the arduino and the website
